It might be a challenging task to understand the transformers of course. But, I have built ViT (Vision Transformer). Why don't I give it a shot?\n",

me\\n\\nYou can see that I\\'ve been crying\\nAnd baby, you know all the right things to say\\nBut do you honestly expect me to believe\\nWe could ever be the same?\\n\\nYou say that the past is the past, you need one chance\\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said, \"Yes.\"\\n\\nYou should\\'ve said \"No\", you should\\'ve gone home\\nYou should\\'ve thought twice \\'fore you let it all

shined\\nIn the sky, the pretty lights\\nAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of us\\nGrowing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled\\nAnd rolled their eyes and said, \"Oh my, my, my\"\\n\\nTake me back to the house in the backyard tree\\nSaid you\\'d beat me up, you were bigger than me\\nYou never did, you never did\\nTake me back when our world was one block wide\\nI dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried\\nJust two kids, you and I\\nOh my, my, my, my\\n\\nWell, I was sixteen when suddenly\\nI wasn\\'t that little girl you used to see\\nBut your eyes still shined like pretty lights\\nAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of us\\nThey never believed we\\'d really fall in love\\nAnd our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes\\nAnd said, \"Oh my, my, my\"\\n\\nTake me back to the creek beds we turned up\\nTwo A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me\\nTake me back to the time we had our very first fight\\nThe slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight\\nYou stayed outside \\'til the morning light\\nOh my, my, my, my\\n\\nA few years had gone and come around\\nWe were sitting at our favorite spot in town\\nAnd you looked at me, got down on one knee\\n\\nTake me back to the time when we walked down the aisle\\nOur whole town came and our mamas cried\\nYou said \"I do\" and I did too\\nTake me home where we met so many years before\\nWe\\'ll rock our babies on that very front porch\\nAfter all this time, you and I\\n\\nI\\'ll be eighty-seven; you\\'ll be eighty-nine\\nI\\'ll still look at you like the stars that shine\\nIn the sky, oh my, my, my\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI was riding shotgun\\nWith my hair undone\\nIn the front seat of his car\\nHe\\'s got a one-hand feel\\nOn the steering wheel\\nThe other on my heart\\nI look around, turn the radio down\\nHe says, \"Baby, is something wrong?\"\\nI say, \"Nothing\\nI was just thinking\\nHow we don\\'t have a song\"\\nAnd he says...\\n\\nOur song is the slamming screen door\\nSneakin\\' out late, tapping on your window\\nWhen we\\'re on the phone and you talk real slow\\n\\'Cause it\\'s late and your mama don\\'t know\\nOur song is the way you laugh\\nThe first date: \"Man, I didn\\'t kiss her, and I should have.\"\\nAnd when I got home ... \\'fore I said, \"Amen\"\\nAsking God if he could play it again\\n\\nI was walking up\\nThe front porch steps\\nAfter everything that day\\nHad gone all wrong\\nAnd been trampled on\\nAnd lost and thrown away\\nGot to the hallway,\\nWell, on my way\\nTo my lovin\\' bed\\nI almost didn\\'t notice\\nAll the roses\\nAnd the note that said...\\n\\nOur song is the slamming screen door\\nSneakin\\' out late, tapping on your window\\nWhen we\\'re on the phone and you talk real slow\\n\\'Cause it\\'s late and your mama don\\'t know\\nOur song is the way you laugh\\nThe first date: \"Man, I didn\\'t kiss her, and I should have\"\\nAnd when I got home ... \\'fore I said, \"Amen\"\\nAsking God if he could play it again\\n\\nI\\'ve heard every album, listened to the radio\\nWaited for something to come along\\nThat was as good as our song...\\n\\n\\'Cause our song is the slamming screen door\\nSneakin\\' out late, tapping on his window\\nWhen we\\'re on the phone and he talks real slow\\n\\'Cause it\\'s late and his mama don\\'t know\\nOur song is the way he laughs\\nThe first date: \"Man, I didn\\'t kiss him, and I should have\"\\nAnd when I got home ... \\'fore I said, \"Amen\"\\nAsking God if he could play it again\\nPlay it again\\n\\nOh, yeah...\\nOh-oh, yeah\\n\\nI was riding shotgun\\nWith my hair undone\\nIn the front seat of his car\\nI grabbed a pen\\nAnd an old napkin\\nAnd I wrote down our song\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFriday night beneath the stars\\nIn a field behind your yard\\nYou and I are paintin\\' pictures in the sky\\nAnd sometimes we don\\'t say a thing\\nJust listen to the crickets sing\\nEverything I need is right here by my side\\n\\nAnd I know everything about you\\nI don\\'t wanna live without you\\n\\nI\\'m only up when you\\'re not down\\nDon\\'t wanna fly if you\\'re still on the ground\\nIt\\'s like no matter what I do\\nWell, you drive me crazy half the time\\nThe other half I\\'m only tryna let you know that what I feel is true\\nAnd I\\'m only me when I\\'m with you\\n\\nJust a small town boy and girl\\nLivin\\' in a crazy world\\nTryna figure out what is and isn\\'t true\\nAnd I don\\'t try to hide my tears\\nMy secrets or my deepest fears\\nThrough it all nobody gets me like you do\\n\\nAnd you know everything about me\\nYou say that you can\\'t live without me\\n\\nI\\'m only up when you\\'re not down\\nDon\\'t wanna fly if you\\'re still on the ground\\nIt\\'s like no matter what I do\\nWell, you drive me crazy

freshman year and you\\'re gonna be here\\nFor the next four years in this town\\nHopin\\' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\\n\\n\\n\\'Cause when you\\'re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\\nYou\\'re gonna believe them\\nAnd when you\\'re fifteen, feelin\\' like there\\'s nothin\\' to figure out\\nWell, count to ten, take it in\\nThis is life before you know who you\\'re gonna be\\nFifteen\\n\\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\\nAnd soon enough, you\\'re best friends\\nLaughin\\' at the other girls who think they\\'re so cool\\nWe\\'ll be outta here as soon as we can\\nAnd then you\\'re on your very first date and he\\'s got a car\\nAnd you\\'re feelin\\' like flyin\\'\\nAnd your mama\\'s waitin\\' up and you\\'re thinkin\\' he\\'s the one\\nAnd you\\'re dancin\\' \\'round your room when the night ends\\nWhen the night ends\\n\\n\\'Cause when you\\'re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\\nYou\\'re gonna believe them\\nAnd when you\\'re fifteen and your first kiss\\nMakes your head spin \\'round\\nBut in your life you\\'ll do things greater than\\nDating the boy on the football team\\nBut I didn\\'t know it at fifteen\\n\\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\\nBack then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday\\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had\\nTo a boy who changed his mind\\nAnd we both cried\\n\\n\\'Cause when you\\'re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\\nYou\\'re gonna believe them\\nAnd when you\\'re fifteen, don\\'t forget to look before you fall\\nI\\'ve found time can heal most anything\\nAnd you just might find who you\\'re supposed to be\\nI didn\\'t know who I was supposed to be\\nAt fifteen\\n\\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la\\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la\\nLa-la-la, la-la-la\\n\\nYour very first day\\nTake a deep breath, girl\\nTake a deep breath as you

party, the ball gowns\\nSee you make your way through the crowd\\nAnd say, \"Hello\"\\nLittle did I know\\n\\nThat you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles\\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\\nAnd I was crying on the staircase\\nBegging you, \"Please don\\'t go,\" and I said\\n\\nRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\\nI\\'ll be waiting, all there\\'s left to do is run\\nYou\\'ll be the prince and I\\'ll be the princess\\nIt\\'s a love story, baby, just say, \"Yes\"\\n\\nSo I sneak out to the garden to see you\\nWe keep quiet \\'cause we\\'re dead if they knew\\nSo close your eyes\\nEscape this town for a little while, oh, oh\\n\\n\\'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter\\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\\nBut you were everything to me\\nI was begging you, \"Please don\\'t go,\" and I said\\n\\nRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\\nI\\'ll be waiting, all there\\'s left to do is run\\nYou\\'ll be the prince and I\\'ll be the princess\\nIt\\'s a love story, baby, just say, \"Yes\"\\nRomeo, save me, they\\'re trying to tell me how to feel\\nThis love is difficult, but it\\'s real\\nDon\\'t be afraid, we\\'ll make it out of this mess\\nIt\\'s a love story, baby, just say, \"Yes\"\\n\\nOh, oh\\n\\nAnd I got tired of waiting\\nWondering if you were ever coming around\\nMy faith in you was fading\\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town\\n\\nAnd I said, \"Romeo, save me, I\\'ve been feeling so alone\\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\\nIs this in my head? I don\\'t know what to think\"\\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you\\'ll never have to be alone\\nI love you and that\\'s all I really know\\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\\nIt\\'s a love story, baby, just say, \\'Yes\\'\"\\n\\nOh, oh, oh\\nOh, oh, oh\\n\\'Cause we were both young when I first saw you\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMmm-mm, mm-mm\\nMmm-mm, mm-mm\\nMmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah\\n\\nHey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving\\nBut I know I saw a light in you\\nAnd as we walked we were talking\\nI didn\\'t say half the things I wanted to\\nOf all the girls tossing rocks at your window\\nI\\'ll be the one waiting there even when it\\'s cold\\nHey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing\\nI don\\'t always have to be alone\\n\\n\\'Cause I can\\'t help it if you look like an angel\\nCan\\'t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so\\nCome feel this magic I\\'ve been feeling since I met you\\nCan\\'t help it if there\\'s no one else\\nMmm, I can\\'t help myself\\n\\nHey Stephen, I\\'ve been holding back this feeling\\nSo I got some things to say to you\\nI\\'ve seen it all, so I thought\\nBut I never seen nobody shine the way you do\\nThe way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name\\nIt\\'s beautiful, wonderful, don\\'t you ever change\\nHey Stephen, why are people always leaving?\\nI think you and I should stay the same\\n\\n\\'Cause I can\\'t help it if you look like an angel\\nCan\\'t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so\\nCome feel this magic I\\'ve been feeling since I met you\\nCan\\'t help it if there\\'s no one else\\nMmm, I can\\'t help myself\\n\\nThey\\'re dimming the street lights, you\\'re perfect for me\\nWhy aren\\'t you here tonight?\\nI\\'m waiting alone now, so come on and come out\\nAnd pull me near and shine, shine, shine\\nHey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons\\nWhy I should be the one you choose\\nAll those other girls, well, they\\'re beautiful\\nBut would they write a song for you?

all\\nAnd you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always.\"\\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom\\nEverything is wrong\\nIt rains when you\\'re here and it rains when you\\'re gone\\n\\'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always.\"\\n\\nWas I out of line?\\nDid I say something way too honest, made you run and hide\\nLike a scared little boy?\\nI looked into your eyes\\nThought I knew you for a minute, now I\\'m not so sure\\nSo here\\'s to everything coming down to nothing\\nHere\\'s to silence that cuts me to the core\\nWhere is this going?\\nThought I knew for a minute, but I

wrong\\nIt rains when you\\'re here and it rains when you\\'re gone\\n\\'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always.\"\\nOh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn\\'t called\\nAnd then you

cold, I\\'ve got my big coat on\\nI hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run\\nPast the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides\\nLook now, the sky is gold\\nI hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home\\n\\nI don\\'t know why all the trees change in the fall\\nBut I know you\\'re not scared of anything at all\\nDon\\'t know if Snow White\\'s house is near or far away\\nBut I know I had the best day with you today\\n\\nI\\'m thirteen now\\nAnd don\\'t know how my friends could be so mean\\nI come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys\\nAnd we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away\\nAnd we talk and window shop \\'til I\\'ve forgotten all their names\\n\\nI don\\'t know who I\\'m going to talk to now at school\\nBut I know I\\'m laughing on the car ride home with you\\nDon\\'t know how long it\\'s going to take to feel okay\\nBut I know I had the best day with you today\\n\\nI have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger\\nGod smiles on my little brother, inside and out\\nHe\\'s better than I am\\nI grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run\\nAnd I had the best days with you\\n\\nThere is a video I found from back when I was three\\nYou set up a paint set in the kitchen and you\\'re talking to me\\nIt\\'s the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs\\nAnd Daddy\\'s smart\\nAnd you\\'re the prettiest lady in the whole wide world\\n\\nAnd now I know why all the trees change in the fall\\nI know you were on my side even when I was wrong\\nAnd I love you for giving me your eyes\\nFor staying back and watching me shine\\nAnd I didn\\'t know if you knew, so I\\'m taking this chance to say\\nThat I had the best day with you today\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, it\\'s a sad picture, the final blow hits you\\nSomebody else gets what you wanted again and\\nYou know it\\'s all the same, another time and place\\nRepeating history and you\\'re getting sick of it\\nBut I believe in whatever you do\\nAnd I\\'ll do anything to see it through\\n\\nBecause these things will change\\nCan you feel it now?\\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\\nThis revolution, the time will come\\nFor us to finally win\\nAnd we\\'ll sing hallelujah, we\\'ll sing hallelujah\\nOh, oh\\n\\nSo we\\'ve been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered\\nIt\\'s hard to fight when the fight ain\\'t fair\\nWe\\'re getting stronger now, find things they never found\\nThey might be bigger but we\\'re faster and never scared\\nYou can walk away, say we don\\'t need this\\nBut there\\'s something in your eyes says we can beat this\\n\\n\\'Cause these things will change\\nCan you feel it now?\\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\\nThis revolution, the time will come\\nFor us to finally win\\nAnd we\\'ll sing hallelujah, we\\'ll sing hallelujah\\nOh, oh\\n\\nTonight, we\\'ll stand, get off our knees\\nFight for what we\\'ve worked for all these years\\nAnd the battle was long, it\\'s the fight of our lives\\nBut we\\'ll stand up champions tonight\\n\\nIt was the night things changed\\nCan you see it now?\\nWhen the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down\\nIt\\'s a revolution, throw your hands up\\n\\'Cause we never gave in\\nAnd we\\'ll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah\\nHallelujah\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI like the way you sound in the morning\\nWe\\'re on the phone and without a warning\\nI realize your laugh is the best sound\\nI have ever heard\\nI like the way I can\\'t keep my focus\\nI watch you talk, you didn\\'t notice\\nI hear the words but all I can think is\\nWe should be together\\n\\nEvery time you smile, I smile\\nAnd every time you shine, I\\'ll shine for you\\n\\nWhoa oh, I\\'m feeling you,

home but you just couldn\\'t keep me\\nBye, bye, baby\\nBye, bye, baby\\n\\nThe picture frame is empty\\nOn the dresser, vacant just like me\\nI see your writing on the dash\\nThen back to your hesitation\\nI was so sure of everything\\nEverything I thought we\\'d always have\\nGuess I never doubted it\\nThen the here and the now floods in\\nFeels like I\\'m becoming a part of your past\\n\\nBye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side\\nBye, bye, baby\\nI want you back but it\\'s come down to nothing\\nAnd all I have is your sympathy\\n\\'Cause you took me home but you just

with the wind\\nJust let it flow\\nLet it take me where it wants to go\\n\\'Til you open the door\\nThere\\'s so much more\\nI\\'d never seen it before\\n\\nI was trying to fly but I couldn\\'t find wings\\nBut you came along and you changed everything\\n\\nYou lift my feet off the ground\\nYou spin me around\\nYou make me crazier, crazier\\nFeels like I\\'m falling and I am lost in your eyes\\nYou make me crazier, crazier, crazier\\n\\nI\\'ve watched from a distance\\nAs you made life your own\\nEvery sky was your own kind of blue\\nAnd I wanted to know\\nHow that would feel\\nAnd you made it so real\\n\\nYou showed me something that I couldn\\'t see\\nYou opened my eyes and you made me believe\\n\\nYou lift my feet off the ground\\nYou spin me around\\nYou make me crazier, crazier\\nFeels like I\\'m falling and I am lost in your eyes\\nYou make me crazier, crazier, crazier\\n\\nBaby, you showed me what living is for\\nI don\\'t wanna hide anymore\\n\\nYou lift my feet

crazier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAh-ah, ah-ah\\nAh-ah, ah-ah\\n\\nYou were in college working part-time, waitin\\' tables\\nLeft a small town, never looked back\\nI was a flight risk with a fear of falling\\nWonderin\\' why we bother with love if it never lasts\\n\\nI say, \"Can you believe it?\"\\nAs we\\'re lyin\\' on the couch\\nThe moment I could see it\\nYes, yes, I can see it now\\n\\nDo you remember, we were sittin\\' there by the water?\\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\\'s careful daughter\\nYou are the best thing that\\'s ever been mine\\n\\nFlash forward and we\\'re takin\\' on the world together\\nAnd there\\'s a drawer of my things at your place\\nYou learn my secrets and you figure out why I\\'m guarded\\nYou say we\\'ll never make my parents\\' mistakes\\n\\nBut we got bills to pay\\nWe got nothing figured out\\nWhen it was hard to take\\nYes, yes, this is what I thought about\\n\\nDo you remember, we were sittin\\' there by the water?\\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\\'s careful daughter\\nYou are the best thing that\\'s ever been mine\\nDo you remember all the city lights on the water?\\nYou saw me start to believe for the first time\\nYou made a rebel of a careless man\\'s careful daughter\\nYou are the best thing that\\'s ever been mine\\n\\nOh-oh, oh\\n\\nAnd I remember that fight, 2:30AM\\nAs everything was slippin\\' right out of our hands\\nI ran out cryin\\' and you followed me out into the street\\nBraced myself for the goodbye\\n\\'Cause that\\'s all I\\'ve ever known\\nThen you took me by surprise\\nYou said, \"I\\'ll never leave you alone\"\\n\\nYou said, \"I remember how it felt sitting by the water\\nAnd every time I look at you, it\\'s like the first time\\nI fell in love with a careless man\\'s careful daughter\\nShe is the best thing that\\'s ever been mine\"\\n\\nHold on and make it last\\nHold on, never turn back\\n(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man\\'s careful daughter\\n(Hold on) You are the best thing that\\'s ever been mine\\n\\nYes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)\\nYes, yes, we\\'re gonna make it now (Hold on, yeah)\\nYes, yes, and I can see it (Hold on)\\nYes, yes, I can see it now (See it now, see it now)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe way you move is like a full on rainstorm\\nAnd I\\'m a house of cards\\nYou\\'re the kind of reckless that should send me runnin\\'\\nBut I kinda know that I won\\'t get far\\nAnd you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch\\nClose enough to hope you couldn\\'t see what I was thinkin\\' of\\n\\nDrop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain\\nKiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\\nGive me something that\\'ll haunt me when you\\'re not around\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\n\\nMy mind forgets to remind me you\\'re a bad idea\\nYou touch me once and it\\'s really somethin\\'\\nYou find I\\'m even better than you imagined I would be\\nI\\'m on my guard for the rest of the world\\nBut with you, I know it\\'s no good\\nAnd I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would\\n\\nDrop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain\\nKiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\\nGive me something that\\'ll haunt me when you\\'re not around\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\n\\nI run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild\\nJust keep on keepin\\' your eyes on me\\nIt\\'s just wrong enough to make it feel right\\nAnd lead me up the staircase, won\\'t you whisper soft and slow?\\nI\\'m captivated by you, baby, like a firework show\\n\\nDrop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain\\nKiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\\nGive me something that\\'ll haunt me when you\\'re not around\\n\\'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\\n\\nAnd the sparks fly\\nOh, baby, smile\\nAnd the sparks fly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m so glad you made time to see me\\nHow\\'s life? Tell me, how\\'s your family?\\nI haven\\'t seen them in a while\\nYou\\'ve been good, busier than ever\\nWe small talk, work and the weather\\nYour guard is up and I know why\\n\\nBecause the last time you saw me\\nIs still burned in the back of your mind\\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die\\n\\nSo, this is me swallowing my pride\\nStandin\\' in front of you sayin\\', \"I\\'m sorry for that night\"\\nAnd I go back to December all the time\\nIt turns out freedom ain\\'t nothing but missin\\' you\\nWishin\\' I\\'d realized what I had when you were mine\\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\\nI go back to December all the time\\n\\nThese days, I haven\\'t been sleeping\\nStayin\\' up, playing back myself leavin\\'\\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn\\'t call\\nThen I think about summer, all the beautiful times\\nI watched you laughin\\' from the passenger side\\nAnd realized I loved you in the fall\\n\\nAnd then the cold came, the dark days\\nWhen fear crept into my mind\\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye\\n\\nSo, this is me swallowing my pride\\nStandin\\' in front of you, sayin\\', \"I\\'m sorry for that night\"\\nAnd I go back to December all the time\\nIt turns out freedom ain\\'t nothing but missin\\' you\\nWishin\\' I\\'d realized what I had when you were mine\\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\\nI go back to December all the time\\n\\nI miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile\\nSo good to me, so right\\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\\nMaybe this is wishful thinkin\\'\\nProbably mindless dreaming\\nBut if we loved again, I swear I\\'d love you right\\nI\\'d go back in time and change it, but I can\\'t\\nSo, if the chain is on your door, I understand\\n\\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\\nStandin\\' in front of you, sayin\\', \"I\\'m sorry for that night\"\\nAnd I go back to December\\nIt turns out freedom ain\\'t nothing but missin\\' you\\nWishin\\' I\\'d realized what I had when you were mine\\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\\nI go back to December all the time\\n\\nAll the time\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am not the kind of girl\\nWho should be rudely bargin\\' in on a white veil occasion\\nBut you are not the kind of boy\\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\\nI sneak in and see your friends\\nAnd her snotty little family all dressed in pastel\\nAnd she is yelling at a bridesmaid\\nSomewhere back inside a room\\nWearin\\' a gown shaped like a pastry\\n\\nThis is surely not what you thought it would be\\nI lose myself in a daydream\\nWhere I stand and say\\n\\nDon\\'t say yes, run away now\\nI\\'ll meet you when you\\'re out\\nOf the church, at the back door\\nDon\\'t wait or say a single vow\\nYou need to hear me out\\nAnd they said, \"Speak now\"\\n\\nFond gestures are exchanged\\nAnd the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march\\nAnd I am hiding in the curtains\\nIt seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be\\n\\nShe floats down the aisle like a pageant queen\\nBut I know you wish it was me\\nYou wish it was me, don\\'t you?\\n\\nDon\\'t say yes, run away now\\nI\\'ll meet you when you\\'re out\\nOf the church, at the back door\\nDon\\'t wait or say a single vow\\nYou need to hear me out\\nAnd they said, \"Speak now\"\\nDon\\'t say yes, run away now (Run away now)\\nI\\'ll meet you when you\\'re out\\nOf the church, at the back door\\nDon\\'t wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)\\nYour time is running out\\nAnd they said, \"Speak now\"\\n\\nOoh (Run away now), la\\nOoh (Say a single vow), ooh\\n\\nI hear the preacher say\\n\\nThere\\'s the silence, there\\'s my last chance\\nI stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me\\nHorrified looks from everyone in the room\\nBut I\\'m only lookin\\' at you\\n\\nI am not the kind of girl\\nWho should be rudely bargin\\' in on a white veil occasion\\nBut you are not the kind of boy\\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl, haha\\n\\nSo, don\\'t say yes, run away now\\nI\\'ll meet you when you\\'re out\\nOf the church, at the back door\\nDon\\'t wait or say a single vow\\nYou need to hear me out\\nThey said, \"Speak now\"\\nAnd you say, \"Let\\'s run away now (Run away now)\\nI\\'ll meet you when I\\'m out\\nOf my tux, at the back door\\nBaby, I didn\\'t say my vows (Say a single vow)\\nSo glad you were around\\nWhen they said, \\'Speak now\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLong were the nights\\nWhen my days once revolved around you\\nCounting my footsteps\\nPrayin\\' the floor won\\'t fall through again\\nAnd my mother accused me of losin\\' my mind\\nBut I swore I was fine\\nYou paint me a blue sky\\nThen go back to turn it to rain\\nAnd I lived in your chess game\\nBut you change the rules every day\\nWonderin\\' which version of you\\nI might get on the phone tonight\\nWell, I stopped pickin\\' up\\nAnd this song is to let you know why\\n\\nDear John, I see it all now that you\\'re gone\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young to be messed with?\\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\\nI shoulda known\\n\\nWell, maybe it\\'s me and my blind optimism to blame\\nOr maybe it\\'s you and your sick need\\nTo give love and take it away\\nAnd you\\'ll add my name to your long list of traitors\\nWho don\\'t understand\\nAnd I\\'ll look back and regret how I ignored when they said\\n\\n\\nDear John, I see it all now that you\\'re gone\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young to be messed with?\\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\\nDear John, I see it all now, it was wrong\\nDon\\'t you think nineteen\\'s too young to be played by\\nYour dark, twisted games when I loved you so?\\nI shoulda known\\n\\nYou are an expert at \"Sorry\" and keepin\\' lines blurry\\nNever impressed by me acing your tests\\nAll the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes\\n\\'Cause you burned them out\\nBut I took your matches before fire could catch me\\nSo don\\'t look now\\nI\\'m shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town\\nOh\\n\\nDear John, I see it all now that you\\'re gone\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young to be messed with?\\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\\nI see it all now that you\\'re gone\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young to be messed with?\\nThe girl in the dress wrote you a song\\nYou shoulda known\\n\\nYou shoulda known\\nDon\\'t you think I was too young?\\nYou shoulda known\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou, with your words like knives\\nAnd swords and weapons that you use against me\\nYou have knocked me off my feet again\\nGot me feeling like I\\'m nothing\\nYou, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard\\nCalling me out when I\\'m wounded\\nYou, pickin\\' on the weaker man\\n\\nWell, you can take me down\\nWith just one single blow\\nBut you don\\'t know what you don\\'t know\\n\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be livin\\' in a big old city\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\\n\\nYou, with your switching sides\\nAnd your wildfire lies and your humiliation\\nYou have pointed out my flaws again\\nAs if I don\\'t already see them\\nI walk with my head down, trying to block you out\\n\\'Cause I\\'ll never impress you\\nI just wanna feel okay again\\n\\nI bet you got pushed around\\nSomebody made you cold\\nBut the cycle ends right now\\n\\'Cause you can\\'t lead me down that road\\nAnd you don\\'t know what you don\\'t know\\n\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be livin\\' in a big old city\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\\n\\nAnd I can see you years from now in a bar\\nTalking over a football game\\nWith that same big, loud opinion but nobody\\'s listening\\nWashed up and ranting about the same old bitter things\\nDrunk and grumblin\\' on about how I can\\'t sing\\nBut all you are is mean\\n\\nAll you are is mean\\nAnd a liar, and pathetic\\nAnd alone in life, and mean\\nAnd mean, and mean, and mean\\n\\nBut someday, I\\'ll be livin\\' in a big old city\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean, yeah\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be livin\\' in a big old city\\n(Why you gotta be so mean?)\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\n(Why you gotta be so mean?)\\nSomeday, I\\'ll be big enough so you can\\'t hit me\\n(Why you gotta be so mean?)\\nAnd all you\\'re ever gonna be is mean\\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI used to think one day we\\'d tell the story of us\\nHow we met and the sparks flew instantly\\nAnd people would say, \"They\\'re the lucky ones\"\\nI used to know my place was the spot next to you\\nNow I\\'m searchin\\' the room for an empty seat\\n\\'Cause lately I don\\'t even know what page you\\'re on\\n\\nOh, a simple complication\\nMiscommunications lead to fallout\\nSo many things that I wish you knew\\nSo many walls up, I can\\'t break through\\n\\nNow I\\'m standin\\' alone in a crowded room\\nAnd we\\'re not speakin\\'\\nAnd I\\'m dyin\\' to know, is it killin\\' you\\nLike it\\'s killin\\' me? Yeah\\nI don\\'t know what to say since the twist of fate\\nWhen it all broke down\\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\\n\\nNext chapter\\n\\nHow\\'d we end up this way?\\nSee me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin\\' to look busy\\nAnd you\\'re doin\\' your best to avoid me\\nI\\'m starting to think one day I\\'ll tell the story of us\\nHow I was losin\\' my mind when I saw you here\\nBut you held your pride like you should\\'ve held me\\n\\nOh, I\\'m scared to see the ending\\nWhy are we pretending this is nothin\\'?\\nI\\'d tell you I miss you, but I don\\'t know how\\nI\\'ve never heard silence quite this loud\\n\\nNow I\\'m standin\\' alone in a crowded room\\nAnd we\\'re not speakin\\'\\nAnd I\\'m dyin\\' to know, is it killin\\' you\\nLike it\\'s killin\\' me? Yeah\\nI don\\'t know what to say since the twist of fate\\nWhen it all broke down\\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\\n\\nThis is looking like a contest\\nOf who can act like they care less\\nBut I liked it better when you were on my side\\nThe battle\\'s in your hands now\\nBut I would lay my armor down\\nIf you said you\\'d rather love than fight\\n\\nSo many things that you wish I knew\\nBut the story of us might be ending soon\\n\\nNow I\\'m standin\\' alone in a crowded room\\nAnd we\\'re not speakin\\'\\nAnd I\\'m dyin\\' to know, is it killin\\' you\\nLike it\\'s killin\\' me?

around my finger\\nAnd it\\'s so quiet in the world tonight\\nYour little eyelids flutter \\'cause you\\'re dreaming\\nSo I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight\\n\\nTo you, everything\\'s funny\\nYou got nothing to regret\\nI\\'d give all I have, honey\\nIf you could stay like that\\n\\nOh, darling, don\\'t you ever grow up\\nDon\\'t you ever grow up, just stay this little\\nOh,

of insincerity\\nShifting eyes and vacancy\\nVanished when I saw your face\\nAll I can say is it was enchanting to meet you\\n\\nYour eyes whispered, \"Have we met?\"\\nAcross the room, your silhouette\\nStarts to make its way to me\\nThe playful conversation starts\\nCounter all your quick remarks\\nLike passing notes in secrecy\\nAnd it was enchanting to meet you\\nAll I can say is I was enchanted to meet you\\n\\nThis night is sparklin\\', don\\'t you let it go\\nI\\'m wonderstruck, blushin\\' all the way home\\nI\\'ll spend forever wonderin\\' if you knew\\nI was enchanted to meet you\\n\\nThe lingering question kept me up\\n2AM, who do you love?\\nI wonder \\'til I\\'m wide awake\\nAnd now, I\\'m pacing back and forth\\nWishing you were at my door\\nI\\'d open up and you would say\\n\\nAll I know is I was enchanted to meet you\\n\\nThis night is sparklin\\', don\\'t you let it go\\nI\\'m wonderstruck, blushin\\' all the way home\\nI\\'ll spend forever wonderin\\' if you knew\\nThis night is flawless, don\\'t you let it go\\nI\\'m wonderstruck, dancing around all alone\\nI\\'ll spend forever wonderin\\' if you knew\\nI was enchanted to meet you\\n\\nThis is me praying that\\nThis was the very first page\\nNot where the storyline ends\\nMy thoughts will echo your name\\nUntil I see you again\\nThese are the words I held back\\nAs I was leaving too soon\\nI was enchanted to meet you\\nPlease, don\\'t be in love with someone else\\nPlease, don\\'t have somebody waiting on you\\nPlease, don\\'t be in love with someone else (Ooh)\\nPlease, don\\'t have somebody waiting on you (Oh-oh)\\n\\nThis night is sparklin\\', don\\'t you let it go\\nI\\'m wonderstruck, blushin\\' all the way home\\nI\\'ll spend forever wonderin\\' if you knew\\nThis night is flawless (Please, don\\'t be in love with someone else)\\nDon\\'t you let it go\\nI\\'m wonderstruck (Please, don\\'t have somebody waiting on you)\\nDancing around all alone\\nI\\'ll spend forever (Please, don\\'t be in love with someone else)\\nWonderin\\' if you knew\\nI was enchanted to meet you\\n\\nPlease, don\\'t be in love with someone else\\nPlease, don\\'t have somebody waiting on you\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow go stand in the corner and think about what you did\\nHa, time for a little revenge\\n\\nThe story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and\\nI had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him\\nShe came along, got him alone, and let\\'s hear the applause\\nShe took him faster than you can say \"Sabotage\"\\nI never saw it coming, wouldn\\'t have suspected it\\nI underestimated just who I was dealing with\\nShe had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum\\nShe underestimated just who she was stealing from\\n\\nShe\\'s not a saint and she\\'s not what

you\\nThe air was cold\\nBut something \\'bout it felt like home somehow and I\\nLeft my scarf there at your sister\\'s house\\nAnd you\\'ve still got it in your drawer even now\\n\\nOh, your sweet disposition\\nAnd my wide-eyed gaze\\nWe\\'re singing in the car, getting lost upstate\\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\\nAnd I know it\\'s long gone and that magic\\'s not here no more\\nAnd I might be okay but I\\'m not fine at all, oh-oh-oh\\n\\n\\'Cause there we are again on that\\nLittle town street\\nYou almost ran the red \\'cause you were\\nLooking over at me\\nWind in my hair, I was there\\nI remember it all too well\\n\\nPhoto album on the counter\\nYour cheeks were turning red\\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\\nAnd your mother\\'s telling stories \\'bout you on the tee ball team\\nYou taught me about your past, thinking your future was me\\nAnd I know it\\'s long gone and there was nothing else I could do\\nAnd I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to\\n\\n\\'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\\nWe\\'re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\\nDown the stairs, I was there\\nI remember it all too well, yeah\\n\\nAnd maybe we got lost in translation\\nMaybe I asked for too much\\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\\nTill you tore it all up\\nRunning scared, I was there\\nI remember it all too well\\n\\nAnd you call me up again\\nJust to break me like a promise\\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\\nI\\'m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\\n\\'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well\\n\\nTime won\\'t fly, it\\'s like I\\'m paralyzed by it\\nI\\'d like to be my old self again but I\\'m still trying to find it\\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\\n\\'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\\nYou can\\'t get rid of it\\n\\'Cause you remember it all too well\\n\\n\\'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\\nBack before you lost the one real thing you\\'ve ever known\\nIt was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well\\nWind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all\\nDown the stairs, you were there, you remember it all\\nIt was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt feels like a perfect night\\nTo dress up like hipsters\\nAnd make fun of our exes\\nAh, ah, ah, ah\\nIt feels like a perfect night\\nFor breakfast at midnight\\nTo fall in love with strangers\\nAh ah, ah, ah\\nYeah, we\\'re happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time\\nIt\\'s miserable and magical, oh yeah\\nTonight\\'s the night when we forget about the deadlines, it\\'s time\\nAh, ah\\n\\nI don\\'t know about you\\nBut I\\'m feeling 22\\nEverything will be alright if\\nYou keep me

yeah\\nWe\\'re happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way\\nIt\\'s miserable and magical, oh yeah\\nTonight\\'s the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it\\'s time\\nAh, ah\\n\\nI

sittin\\' in your chair by the window\\nLooking out at the city and I bet\\nSometimes you wonder \\'bout me\\n\\nAnd I just want to tell you\\nIt takes everything in me\\nNot to call you\\nAnd I wish I could run to you\\nAnd I hope you know that\\nEvery time I don\\'t\\nI almost do\\nI almost do\\n\\nI bet you think I either moved on or hate you\\n\\'Cause each time you reach out, there\\'s no reply\\nI bet it never, ever occurred to you\\nThat I can\\'t say hello to you and risk another goodbye\\n\\nAnd I just want to tell you\\nIt takes everything in me\\nNot to call you\\nAnd I wish I could run to you\\nAnd I hope you know that\\nEvery time I don\\'t\\nI almost do, I almost do\\n\\nOh, we made quite a mess, babe\\nIt\\'s probably better off this way\\nAnd I confess, baby\\nIn my

you\\'re sittin\\' in your chair by the window\\nLooking out at the city and I hope\\nSometimes you wonder \\'bout me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI remember when we broke up the first time\\nSaying, \"This is it, I\\'ve had enough\", \\'cause like\\nWe hadn\\'t seen each other in a month\\nWhen you said you needed space, what?\\nThen you come around again and say\\n\\nRemember how that lasted for a day?\\nI say, \"I hate you,\" we break up, you call me, \"I love you\"\\n\\nOoh, we called it off again last night but\\nOoh, this time I\\'m telling you, I\\'m telling you\\n\\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\\nBut we are never ever ever ever getting back together\\n\\nLike, ever\\n\\nI\\'m really gonna miss you picking fights\\nAnd me falling for it, screaming that I\\'m right\\nAnd you would hide away and find your peace of mind\\nWith some indie record that\\'s much cooler than mine\\n\\nOoh, you called me up again tonight but\\nOoh, this time, I\\'m telling you, I\\'m telling you\\n\\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\\nBut we are never ever ever ever getting back together\\n\\nYeah\\nYeah\\nYeah\\n\\nI used to think that we were forever ever\\nAnd I used to say never say never\\n\\nSo he calls me up and he\\'s like, \"I still love you\"\\nAnd I\\'m like, I\\'m just, I mean this is exhausting you know?\\nLike we are never getting back together\\nLike, ever\\n\\n(No)\\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\\nWe are never ever ever getting back together\\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\\nBut we are never ever ever ever getting back together\\n\\n(We)\\nNo\\n(Getting back together)\\n(We)\\n(Getting back together)\\nYou go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\\n(Talk to me)\\nBut we are never ever ever ever getting back together\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure we almost broke up last night\\nI threw my phone across the room at you\\nI was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed\\n\\nThis morning I said we should talk about it\\n\\'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved\\nThat\\'s when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, \"Ok, let\\'s talk\"\\nAnd I said\\n\\nStay, stay, stay\\nI\\'ve been loving you for quite some time, time, time\\nYou think that it\\'s funny when I\\'m mad, mad, mad\\nBut I think that it\\'s best if we both stay\\n\\nBefore you I\\'d only dated self-indulgent takers\\nWho took all of their problems out on me\\nBut you carry my groceries and now I\\'m always laughing\\nAnd I love you because you have given me no choice but to\\n\\nStay, stay, stay\\nI\\'ve been loving you for quite some time, time, time\\nYou think that it\\'s funny when I\\'m mad, mad, mad\\nBut I think that it\\'s best if we

leave\\nIt\\'s been occurring to me\\nI\\'d like to hang out with you\\nFor my whole life\\n\\nStay\\nAnd I\\'ll be loving you for quite some time\\nNo one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad\\nSo I think that it\\'s best if we both stay\\nStay, stay, stay, stay, stay\\n\\nStay, stay, stay\\nI\\'ve been loving you for quite some time, time, time\\nYou think that it\\'s funny when I\\'m

your lover in the foyer doesn\\'t even know you\\nAnd your secrets end up splashed on the news front page\\nAnd they tell you that you\\'re lucky, but you\\'re so confused\\n\\'Cause you don\\'t feel pretty, you just feel used\\nAnd all the young things line up to take your place\\n\\nAnother name goes up in lights\\nYou wonder if you\\'ll make it out alive\\n\\nAnd they\\'ll tell you now,

fall apart\\nAnd the sinking feeling starts\\nAs I say hopelessly\\n\\n\\nAnd it was like slow motion\\nStanding there in my party dress\\nIn red lipstick\\nWith no one to impress\\nAnd they\\'re all laughing\\nAnd asking me about you\\nBut there was one thing missing (Missing)\\nAnd that was the moment I knew\\n\\nWhat do you say\\nWhen tears are streaming down your face\\nIn front of everyone

knew\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou said it in a simple way\\n4 AM, the second day\\nHow strange that I don\\'t know you at all\\nStumbled through the long goodbye\\nOne last kiss, then catch your flight\\nRight when I was just about to fall\\n\\nI told myself, don\\'t get attached\\nBut in my mind, I play it back\\nSpinning faster than the plane that took you\\n\\nAnd this is when the feeling sinks in\\nI don\\'t wanna miss you like this\\nCome back, be here, come back, be here\\nI guess you\\'re in New York today\\nI don\\'t wanna need you this way\\nCome back, be here, come back, be here\\n\\nThe

this\\nCome back, be here, come back, be here\\nI guess you\\'re in London today\\nAnd I don\\'t wanna need you this way\\nCome back, be here, come back, be here\\n\\nThis is falling in love in the cruellest way\\nThis is falling for you when you are worlds away\\nIn New York, be here\\nBut you\\'re in London, and I break down\\n\\'Cause it\\'s not fair that you\\'re not around\\n\\nThis is when the feeling sinks in\\nI don\\'t wanna miss you like this\\nCome back, be here, come back, be here\\nI guess you\\'re in New York today\\nAnd I don\\'t wanna need you this way\\nCome back, be here,

upstanding and right\\nIt\\'s kinda like a code, yeah\\nAnd you\\'ve been getting closer and closer\\nAnd crossing so many lines\\n\\nAnd it would be a fine proposition\\nIf I was a stupid girl\\nBut,

got a girl at home\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\nI see you turn off your phone\\nAnd now you\\'ve got me alone, and I say\\nDon\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\n\\nI just wanna make sure\\nYou understand perfectly\\nYou\\'re the kind of man who makes me sad\\nWhile she waits up\\nYou chase down the newest thing\\nAnd take for granted what you have\\n\\nAnd it would be a fine proposition\\nIf I was a stupid girl\\nAnd, yeah, I might go with it\\nIf I hadn\\'t once been just like her\\n\\nSo don\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah\\nDon\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody knows that\\nI see you turn off

number\\nYou\\'re about to lose your girl\\nCall a cab, lose my number\\nLet\\'s consider this lesson learned\\n\\nDon\\'t look at me, you got a girl at home\\nAnd everybody knows that, everybody

the hallway\\nI remember your little laugh\\nRace cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs\\nI love you to the moon and back\\nI remember your blue eyes looking into mine\\nLike we had our own secret club\\nI remember you dancing before bed time\\nThen jumping on me, waking me up\\nI can still feel you hold my hand, little man\\nAnd even the moment I knew\\nYou fought it hard like an army guy\\nRemember I leaned in and whispered to you\\n\\n\"Come on, baby, with me\\nWe\\'re going to fly away from here\\nYou were my best four years\"\\n\\nI remember the drive home\\nWhen the blind hope turned to crying and screaming \"Why?\"\\nFlowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say\\nAbout a beautiful boy who died\\nAnd it\\'s about to be Halloween\\nYou could be anything you wanted if you were still here\\nI remember the last day, when I kissed your face\\nAnd whispered in your ear\\n\\n\"Come on, baby, with me\\nWe\\'re going to fly away from here\\nOut of this curtained room and this hospital gray, we\\'ll just disappear\\nCome on, baby, with me\\nWe\\'re going to fly away from here\\nYou were my best four years\"\\n\\nWhat if I\\'m standing in your closet trying to talk to you?\\nAnd what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won\\'t grow into?\\nAnd what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?\\nWhat if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?\\n\\nCome on, baby, with me\\nWe\\'re going to fly away from here\\nCome on, baby, with me\\nWe\\'re going to fly away from here\\nYou were my best four years\\n\\nI remember your bare feet, down the hallway\\nI love you to the moon and back\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI know I\\'m probably better off on my own\\nThan lovin\\' a man who didn\\'t know what he had when he had it\\nAnd I see the permanent

something \\'bout it felt like home somehow\\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister\\'s house\\nAnd you\\'ve still got it in your drawer, even now\\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\\nWe\\'re singing in the car, getting lost upstate\\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\\n\\nAnd I know it\\'s long gone and\\nThat magic\\'s not here no more\\nAnd I might be okay, but I\\'m not fine at all\\nOh, oh, oh\\n\\n\\'Cause there we are again on that little town street\\nYou almost ran the red \\'cause you were lookin\\' over at me\\nWind in my hair, I was there\\nI remember it all too well\\n\\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\\nAnd your mother\\'s telling stories \\'bout you on the tee-ball team\\nYou taught me \\'bout your past, thinking your future was me\\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"fuck the patriarchy\"\\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\\nHe\\'s gonna say it\\'s love, you never called it what it was\\n\\'Til we were dead and gone and buried\\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it\\'s the same\\nAfter three months in the grave\\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\\n\\nAnd I know it\\'s long gone and\\nThere was nothing else I could do\\nAnd I forget about you long enough\\nTo forget why I needed to\\n\\n\\'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\\nWe\\'re dancing \\'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\\nDown the stairs, I was there\\nI remember it all too well\\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\\nSacred prayer and we\\'d swear\\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\\n\\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\\nMaybe I asked for too much\\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\\n\\'Til you tore it all up\\nRunning scared, I was there\\nI remember it all too well\\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\\nI\\'m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\\n\\'Cause I remember it all, all, all\\n\\nThey say all\\'s well that ends well, but I\\'m in a new Hell\\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\\nAnd that made me want to die\\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\\nThat\\'s what happened, you\\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\\nSipping coffee like you\\'re on a late-night show\\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\\nAnd he said, \"It\\'s supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\\n\\nTime won\\'t fly, it\\'s like I\\'m paralyzed by it\\nI\\'d like to be my old self again, but I\\'m still trying to find it\\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\\n\\'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\\nYou can\\'t get rid of it\\n\\'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\\n\\'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\\nBack before you lost the one real thing you\\'ve ever known\\n\\nIt was rare, I was there\\nI remember it all too well\\nWind in my hair, you were there\\nYou remember it all\\nDown the stairs, you were there\\nYou remember it all\\nIt was rare, I was there\\nI remember it all too well\\n\\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\\n\\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\\nI\\'m a soldier who\\'s returning half her weight\\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\\n\\'Cause in this city\\'s barren cold\\nI still remember the first fall of snow\\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\\nI remember it all too well\\n\\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\\nIt was rare, you remember it\\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\\nIt was rare, you remember it\\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\\nIt was rare, you remember it\\n\\n2013\\n\\n\\n\\nHit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh\\nOnly sound, only sound that you hear is

enough\\nTo live for the hope of it all\\nCancel plans just in case you\\'d call\\nAnd say \"Meet me behind the mall\"\\nSo much for summer love, and saying \"Us\"\\n\\'Cause you weren\\'t mine to

trying\\n\\nThey told me all of my cages were mental\\nSo I got wasted like all my potential\\nAnd my words shoot to kill when I\\'m mad\\nI have a lot of regrets about that\\nI was so ahead of the

you\\'re out for a run\\nYou\\'ll be flushed when you return\\nTake the road less traveled by\\nTell yourself you can always stop\\nWhat started in beautiful rooms\\nEnds with meetings in parking lots\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the thing about illicit affairs\\nAnd clandestine meetings\\nAnd longing stares\\nIt\\'s born from just one single glance\\nBut it dies and it dies and it dies\\n...a million little times\\n\\nLeave the perfume on the shelf\\nThat you picked out just for him\\nSo you leave no trace behind\\nLike you don\\'t even exist\\nTake the words for what they are\\nA dwindling, mercurial high\\nA drug that only worked\\nThe first few hundred times\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the thing about illicit affairs\\nAnd clandestine meetings\\nAnd stolen stares\\nThey show their truth one single time\\nBut they lie and they lie and they lie\\n...a million little times\\n\\nAnd you wanna scream\\nDon\\'t call me \"kid\"\\nDon\\'t call me \"baby\"\\nLook at this godforsaken mess that you made me\\nYou showed me colors you know I can\\'t see with anyone else\\nDon\\'t call me \"kid\"\\nDon\\'t call me \"baby\"\\nLook at this idiotic fool that you made me\\nYou taught me a secret

like an American singer\\n\\nTime\\nMystical time\\nCutting me open, then healing me fine\\nWere there clues I didn\\'t see?\\nAnd isn\\'t it just so pretty to think\\nAll along there was some\\nInvisible string\\nTying you to me?\\n\\nA string that pulled me\\nOut of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar\\nSomething wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire\\nChains around my demons\\nWool to brave the seasons\\nOne single thread of gold tied me to you\\n\\nCold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart\\nNow I send their babies presents\\nGold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park\\nHell was the journey but it brought me heaven\\n\\nTime\\nWondrous time\\nGave me the blues and then purple-pink skies\\nAnd

sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down\\nI was younger then, take me back to when I\\n\\nFound my heart and broke it here\\nMade friends and lost them through the years\\nAnd I\\'ve not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I\\'ve grown\\nBut I can\\'t wait to go home\\n\\nI\\'m on my way\\nDriving at 90 down those country lanes\\nSinging to \\\\\"Tiny Dancer\\\\\"\\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, and it\\'s real\\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes\\nRunning from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends\\nHad my first kiss on a Friday night, I don\\'t reckon that I did it right\\nBut I was younger then, take me back to when\\n\\nWe found weekend jobs, when we got paid\\nWe\\'d buy cheap spirits and drink them straight\\nMe and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we\\'ve grown\\nBut I can\\'t wait to go home\\n\\nI\\'m on my way\\nDriving at 90 down those country lanes\\nSinging to \\\\\"Tiny Dancer\\\\\"\\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, and it\\'s real\\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\n\\nOne friend left to sell clothes\\nOne works down by the coast\\nOne had two kids but lives alone\\nOne\\'s brother overdosed\\nOne\\'s already on his second wife\\nOne\\'s just barely getting by\\nBut these people raised me\\nAnd I can\\'t wait to go home\\n\\nAnd I\\'m on my way, I still remember\\nThese old country lanes\\nWhen we did not know the answers\\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel, it\\'s real\\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\nOver the castle on the hill\\nYou are the one, girl\\nYou know that it\\'s true\\nI\\'m feeling younger\\nEvery time that I\\'m alone with you\\n\\nWe were sitting in a parked car\\nStealing kisses in a front yard\\nWe got questions we shouldn\\'t had asked but\\n\\nHow would you feel\\nIf I told you I loved you\\nIt\\'s just something that I want to do\\nI\\'m taking my time, spending my life\\nFalling deeper in love with you\\nSo tell me that you love me too\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the summer, as the lilacs blew\\nBlood flows deeper than a river\\nEvery moment that I spend with you\\n\\nWe were sat upon our best friend\\'s roof\\nI had both of my arms around you\\nWatching the sunrise replace the moon\\n\\nHow would you feel\\nIf I told you I loved you\\nIt\\'s just something that I want to do\\nI\\'m taking my time, spending my life\\nFalling deeper in love with you\\nSo tell me that you love me too\\n\\nWe were sitting in a parked car\\nStealing kisses in a front yard\\nWe got questions we shouldn\\'t had asked\\n\\nHow would you feel\\nIf I told you I loved you\\nIt\\'s just something that I want to do\\nI\\'m taking my time, spending my life\\nFalling deeper in love with you\\nSo tell me that you love me too\\nTell me that you love me too\\nTell me that you love me too\\nWhen your legs don\\'t work like they used to before\\nAnd I can\\'t sweep you off of your feet\\nWill your mouth still remember the taste of my love?\\nWill your eyes still smile from your cheeks?\\n\\nAnd darling I will be loving you \\'til we\\'re 70\\nAnd baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23\\nAnd I\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\nMaybe just the touch of a hand\\nWell, me I fall in love with you every single day\\nAnd I just wanna tell you I am\\nSo honey now\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nPlace your head on my beating heart\\nI\\'m thinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\n\\nWhen my hair\\'s all but gone and my memory fades\\nAnd the crowds don\\'t remember my name\\nWhen my hands don\\'t play the strings the same way\\nI know you will still love me the same\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it\\'s evergreen\\nAnd baby your smile\\'s forever in my mind and memory\\nI\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\nMaybe it\\'s all part of a plan\\nWell, I\\'ll just keep on making the same mistakes\\nHoping that you\\'ll understand\\nBut baby now\\n\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nPlace your head on my beating heart\\nThinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\n\\nSo baby now\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nOh darling, place your head on my beating heart\\nI\\'m thinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\nOh baby we found love right where we are\\n\\nAnd we found love right where we are\\nIt\\'s just another night, and I\\'m staring at the moon\\nI saw a shooting star and thought of you\\nI sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew\\nIf you were here, I\\'d sing to you\\nYou\\'re on the other side, as this skyline splits in two\\nMiles away from seeing you\\nBut I can see the stars from America\\nI wonder do you see them too?\\n\\nSo open your eyes and see, the way our horizons meet\\nAnd all of the lights will lead, into the night with me\\nAnd I know these scars will bleed\\nBut both of our hearts believe\\nAll of these stars will guide us home\\n\\nI can hear your heart on the radio beat\\nThey\\'re playing \\\\\"Chasing Cars\\\\\" and I thought of us\\nBack to the time you were laying next to me\\nI looked across and fell in love\\nSo I took your hand back through London\\'s streets and knew\\nEverything led back to you\\nSo can you see the stars over Amsterdam?\\nHear the song our heart is beating to?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet\\nAnd all of the lights will lead into the night with me\\nAnd I know these scars will bleed\\nBut both of our hearts believe\\nAll of these stars will guide us home\\n\\nAnd all\\nAnd all\\nAnd all\\nI can see the stars from America\\nThings were all good yesterday\\nAnd then the devil took your memory\\nAnd if you fell to your death today\\nI hope that heaven is your resting place\\nI heard the doctors put your chest in pain\\nBut then that could have been the medicine\\nAnd now you\\\\u2019re lying in the bed again\\nEither way I\\\\u2019ll cry with the rest of them.\\n\\nAnd my father told me, \\\\u201cSon,\\nIt\\\\u2019s not his fault he doesn\\\\u2019t know your face,\\nAnd you\\\\u2019re not the only one.\\nAlthough my grandma used to say, that he used to sing\\n\\nDarling hold me in your arms the way you did last night\\nAnd we\\'ll lie inside, a little while he wrote\\nI could look into your eyes until the sun comes up\\nAnd we\\\\u2019re wrapped in light, in life, in love.\\nPut your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut\\nFor they\\\\u2019re designed to be together oh\\nWith your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one\\nAnd we\\\\u2019re set alight, we\\\\u2019re afire love, love, love oh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThings were all good yesterday\\nThen the devil took your breath away\\nAnd now we\\\\u2019re left here in the pain\\nBlack suit, black tie standin\\' in the rain\\nAnd now my family is one again\\nStapled together with the strangers and a friend.\\nCame to my mind I should paint it with a pen\\nSix years old I remember when.\\n\\nAnd my father told me, \\\\u201cSon,\\nIt\\\\u2019s not his fault he doesn\\\\u2019t know your face,\\nAnd you\\\\u2019re not the only one.\\nAlthough my grandma used to say, he used to say\\\\u2026\\n\\nDarling hold me in your arms the way you did last night\\nAnd we\\'ll lie inside, a little while he wrote\\nI could look into your eyes until the sun comes up\\nAnd we\\\\u2019re wrapped in light, in life, in love.\\nPut your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut\\nFor they\\\\u2019re designed to be together oh\\nWith your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one\\nAnd we\\\\u2019re set alight, we\\\\u2019re afire love, love, love oh\\n\\nAnd my father and all of my family\\nRise from the seats to sing hallelujah\\nAnd my mother and all of my family\\nRise from the seats to sing halellujah\\nAnd my brother and all of my family\\nRise from the seats to sing hallelujah\\nAnd all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah\\nAnd my father and all of my

Lord\\'s house, but stopped at the age of nine\\nI forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride\\nThe paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind\\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\\nAnd when the world\\'s against me is when I really come alive\\nAnd everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\\nYou know that I\\'ve got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs\\nI think life has got to the point I know without it\\'s no fun\\nI need to get in the right mind and clear myself up\\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what I\\'ve become\\nI guess it\\'s a stereotypical day for someone like me\\nWithout a nine-to-five job or an uni degree\\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\\nThey showed me the locked doors I find another use of key\\nAnd you\\'ll see\\n\\nI\\'m well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me\\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\\nAnother one to take the sting away\\nI am happy on my own, so here I\\'ll stay\\nSave your lovin\\' arms for a rainy day\\nAnd I\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\nEraser\\n\\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\\nI chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\\nI think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell\\nRelationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well\\nAnd ain\\'t nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\\nBecause you\\'re living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\\nPlease know that I\\'m not trying to preach like I\\'m Reverend Run\\nI beg you, don\\'t be disappointed with the man I\\'ve become\\nOur conversations with my father on the A14\\nAge twelve telling me I\\'ve gotta chase those dreams\\nNow I\\'m playing for the people, dad, and they know me\\nWith my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans\\nWembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou\\nI may have grown up but I hope that Damien\\'s proud\\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration\\'s allowed\\nThe world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now\\nSomehow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\\nAnother one to take the sting away\\nI am not beyond my own, so here I\\'ll stay\\nSave your lovin arms for a rainy day\\nAnd I\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\nEraser\\nAnd I\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\nEraser\\nAnd I\\'ll find comfort in my pain\\nEraser\\n\\nI woke up this morning lookin\\' in the mirror\\nThinkin\\' to myself that I should probably be thinner\\nThe industry told me to look like them\\nBut I found my happiness in fried

pool\\nAnd then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room\\nAs last orders were called was when she stood on the stool\\nAfter dancing to C\\\\u00e8ilidh singing to trad tunes\\nI never heard Carrickfergus ever sing so sweet\\nA capella in the bar wring her feet for the beat\\nOh, I could have that while playing on repeat for a week\\nAnd in this packed out room swear she was singing to me\\n\\nShe played the fiddle in an Irish band\\nBut she fell in love with an English man\\nKissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand\\nSaid baby I just want to dance\\nMy pretty little Galway Girl\\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\\n\\nNow we\\'ve outstayed our welcome and it\\'s closing time\\nI was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine\\nOur coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine\\nAs we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night\\nI walked her home then she took me inside\\nFinish some Doritos and another bottle of wine\\nI swear I\\'m going to pot you in a song that I write\\nAbout a Galway Girl and a perfect night\\n\\nShe played the fiddle in an Irish band\\nBut she fell in love with an English man\\nKissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand\\nSaid baby I just want to dance\\nMy pretty little Galway Girl\\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\\nMy, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl\\nShe is the sweetest thing that I know\\nShould see the way she holds me when the lights go low\\nShakes my soul like a pothole every time\\nTook my heart upon a one way trip\\nGuess she went wandering off with it\\nNone like most women I know\\nThis one will bring it back whole\\nDaisies, daisies perched upon your forehead\\nOh my baby, lately I know...\\n\\nThat every night I\\'ll kiss you, you\\'ll say in my ear\\nOh we\\'re in love, aren\\'t we?\\nHands in your hair\\nFingers and thumbs, baby\\nI feel safe when you\\'re holding me near\\nLove the way that you conquer your fear\\nYou know hearts don\\'t break around here\\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah\\nYeah-yeah, yeah-yeah\\n\\nShe is the river flowin\\' nowhere\\nAnd tin wind chimes used for doorbells\\nFields and trees and her smell fill my lungs\\nSpend my summertime beside her\\nAnd the rest of the year the same\\nShe is the flint that sparks the lighter\\nAnd the fuel that will hold the flame, oh\\nRoses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my\\nAll this, all this I know\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut every night I\\'ll kiss you, you\\'ll say in my ear\\nOh we\\'re in love, aren\\'t we?\\nHands in your hair\\nFingers and thumbs, baby\\nI feel safe when you\\'re holding me near\\nLove the way that you conquer your fear\\nYou know hearts don\\'t break around here\\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah\\nYeah-yeah, yeah-yeah\\n\\nWell, I\\'ve found love inside\\nThe arms of the woman I know\\nShe is the lighthouse in the night\\nThat will safely guide me home\\nAnd I\\'m not scared of passing over\\nOr the thought growing old\\n\\'Cause from now until I go\\n\\nEvery night I kiss you, you\\'ll say in my ear\\nOh we\\'re in love, aren\\'t we?\\nHands in your hair\\nFingers and thumbs, baby\\nI feel safe when you\\'re holding me near\\nLove the way that you conquer your fear\\nYou know hearts don\\'t break around here\\nOh yeah, yeah\\nEvery night I kiss you, you\\'ll say in my ear\\nOh we\\'re in love, aren\\'t we?\\nHands in your hair\\nFingers and thumbs, baby\\nI feel safe when you\\'re holding me near\\nLove the

that it\\'s true\\nI\\'m feeling younger\\nEvery time that I\\'m alone with you\\n\\nWe were sitting in a parked car\\nStealing kisses in a front yard\\nWe got questions we shouldn\\'t had asked but\\n\\nHow would you feel\\nIf I told you I loved you\\nIt\\'s just something that I want to do\\nI\\'m taking my time, spending my life\\nFalling deeper in love with you\\nSo tell me that you love me too\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the summer, as the lilacs blew\\nBlood flows deeper than a river\\nEvery moment that I spend with you\\n\\nWe were sat upon our best friend\\'s roof\\nI had both of my arms around you\\nWatching the sunrise replace the moon\\n\\nHow would you feel\\nIf I told you I loved you\\nIt\\'s just something that I want to do\\nI\\'m taking my time, spending my life\\nFalling deeper in love with you\\nSo tell me that you love me too\\n\\nWe were sitting in a parked car\\nStealing kisses in a front yard\\nWe got questions we shouldn\\'t had asked\\n\\nHow would you

you love me too\\nTell me that you love me too\\nWalking down 29th and park\\nI saw you in another\\'s arms\\nOnly a month we\\'ve been apart\\nYou look happier\\n\\nSaw you walk inside a bar\\nHe said something to make you laugh\\nI saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours\\nYeah, you look happier, you do\\n\\nAin\\'t nobody hurt you like I hurt you\\nBut ain\\'t nobody love you like I do\\nPromise that I will not take it personal, baby\\nIf you\\'re moving on with someone new\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Cause baby you look happier, you do\\nMy friends told me one day I\\'ll feel it too\\nAnd until then I\\'ll smile to hide the truth\\nBut I know I was happier with you\\n\\nSat on the corner of the room\\nEverything\\'s reminding me of you\\nNursing an empty bottle and telling myself you\\'re happier\\nAren\\'t you?\\n\\nAin\\'t nobody hurt you like I hurt you\\nBut ain\\'t nobody need you like I do\\nI know that there\\'s others that deserve you\\nBut my darling, I am still in love with you\\n\\nBut I guess you look happier, you do\\nMy friends told me one day I\\'d feel it too\\nI know I could smile to hide the truth\\nBut I know I was happier with you\\n\\nBaby, you look happier, you do\\nI knew one day you\\'d fall for someone new\\nBut if he breaks your heart like lovers do\\nJust know that I\\'ll be waiting\\\\u00a0here for you...\\nOh, misty eye of the mountain below\\nKeep careful watch of my brothers\\' souls\\nAnd should the sky be filled with fire and smoke\\nKeep watching over Durin\\'s son\\n\\nIf this is to end in fire\\nThen we should all burn together\\nWatch the flames climb high into the night\\nCalling out father, stand by and we will\\nWatch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side\\n\\nAnd if we should die tonight\\nThen we should all die together\\nRaise a glass of wine for the last time\\nCalling out father, prepare as we will\\nWatch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side\\nDesolation comes upon the sky\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow I see fire, inside the mountain\\nI see fire, burning the trees\\nAnd I see fire, hollowing souls\\nI see fire, blood in the breeze\\nAnd I hope that you\\'ll remember me\\n\\nOh, should my people fall\\nThen surely I\\'ll do the same\\nConfined in mountain halls\\nWe got too close to the flame\\nCalling out father hold fast and we will\\nWatch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side\\nDesolation comes upon the sky\\n\\nNow I see fire, inside the mountain\\nI see fire, burning the trees\\nI see fire, hollowing souls\\nI see fire, blood in the breeze\\nAnd I hope that you\\'ll remember me\\n\\nAnd if the night is burning\\nI will cover my eyes\\nFor if the dark returns then\\nMy brothers will die\\nAnd as the sky\\'s falling down\\nIt crashed into this lonely town\\nAnd with that shadow upon the ground\\nI hear my people screaming out\\n\\nNow I see fire, inside the mountain\\nI see fire, burning the trees\\nI see fire, hollowing souls\\nI see fire, blood in the breeze\\n\\nI see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning (fire)\\nI see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire)\\nAnd I see fire (fire)\\nAnd I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side\\n[Verse 1: Tori Kelly]\\nA dangerous plan, just this time\\nA stranger\\'s hand clutched in mine\\nI\\'ll take this chance, so call me blind\\nI\\'ve been waiting all my

habits\\nActing as if we were two rabbits\\nAnd then you\\'d vanish\\nBack to the borrow with all the Celtics\\nI disappear\\nYou call me selfish, I understand\\nBut I can\\\\u2019t help it\\nI put my job over everything\\nExcept my family and friends\\nBut you\\\\u2019ll be in between forever\\nSo I guess we\\\\u2019ll have to take a step back\\nOverlook the situation\\nCause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications\\nAnd I\\\\u2019m not saying we should be taking a break\\nJust re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it\\\\u2019s too late\\nSo we kinda need to deal with the pain\\nOr wait to get on the plane\\nBut in the day we\\\\u2019ll have to say it again\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOh Nina\\nYou should go Nina\\n\\\\u2018Cause I ain\\\\u2019t ever coming home\\nNina, oh, won\\\\u2019t you leave me now\\nAnd I\\\\u2019ve been living on the road Nina\\nBut then again you should know Nina\\nCause that\\\\u2019s you and me both\\nNina, oh, won\\\\u2019t you leave me now\\nNow\\n\\nLove will come and love will go\\nBut you can make it on your own\\nSing that song, go, oh won\\\\u2019t you leave me now\\nPeople grow, and fall apart\\nBut you can mend your broken heart\\nTake it back, oh oh won\\\\u2019t you leave me now\\n\\nOh Nina\\nYou should go Nina\\n\\\\u2018Cause I ain\\\\u2019t ever coming home\\nNina, oh, won\\\\u2019t you leave me now\\nAnd I\\\\u2019ve been living on the road Nina\\nBut then again you should know Nina\\nCause that\\\\u2019s you and me both\\nNina, oh, won\\\\u2019t you leave me now\\nNow\\nNo, no, no, no,

comes\\nAnd he\\'s older in the presence of somebody young\\nTelling him the same things that he told me\\nAnd he reacts the same way as that OG\\nBut it\\'s old school, it\\'s like \\'03\\nAnd this old man is my old me\\nTakes a long time to happen so fast\\nTo realize that your future is somebody else\\'s past\\nWassup\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs long as I\\'m here\\nAs long as you love me\\nGive me

you stay?\\nWon\\'t you stay?\\nI gave all my oxygen to people that could breath\\nI gave many my money and now we don\\'t even speak\\nI drive miles and miles but would you do the same for me\\nOh, honestly?\\nOffered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon\\\\u00a0\\nGave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm\\nThey gave me the heartache and in return I gave a wing\\nIts goes on and on and on\\n\\nLife can get you down so I just numb the way it feels\\nI drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills\\nAnd all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf, my farewell\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\n\\nI gave you all my energy and I took away your pain\\n\\'Cause human beings are destined to [?] or drink\\nWhat time do we stand upon come have it looks the same?\\nAnd only scars remain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLife can get you down so I just numb the way it feels\\nI drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills\\nAnd all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf my farewell\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\n\\nBut if don\\'t then I\\'ll go back to where I\\'m becoming a stranger\\nJust because they ended being just like that\\nOh, I\\'m here again between the devil and the danger\\nBut I guess it\\'s hust of nature\\nMy dad was wrong \\'cause I\\'m not like my mum\\n\\'Cause she\\'d just smile and I\\'m complaining in a song, but it helps\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\n\\nLife can get you down so I just numb the way it feels\\nI drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills\\nAnd all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf, my farewell\\nSo before I save someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\nAnd before I blame someone else, I\\'ve got to save myself\\nAnd before I love someone else, I\\'ve got to love myself\\nI took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill\\nI threw the day old tea from the cup\\nPacked\\\\u00a0up the photo album Matthew had made\\nMemories of a life that\\'s been loved\\nTook the get well soon cards and stuffed animals\\nPoured the old ginger been down the sink\\nDad always told me, \\\\\"Don\\'t you cry when you\\'re down\\\\\"\\nBut mum, there\\'s a tear every time that I blink\\n\\nOh I\\'m in pieces, it\\'s tearing me up, but I know\\nA heart that\\'s broke is a heart that\\'s been loved\\n\\nSo I\\'ll sing Hallelujah\\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\\nWhen I fell down you\\'d be there holding me up\\nSpread your wings as you go\\nAnd when God takes you back we\\'ll say Hallelujah\\nYou\\'re home\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up\\nFolded your nightgowns neatly in a case\\nJohn says he\\'d drive then put his hand on my cheek\\nAnd wiped a tear from the side of my face\\n\\nI hope that I see the world as you did cause I know\\nA life with love is a life that\\'s been lived\\n\\nSo I\\'ll sing Hallelujah\\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\\nWhen I fell down you\\'d be there holding me up\\nSpread your wings as you go\\nAnd when God takes you back we\\'ll say Hallelujah\\nYou\\'re home\\nHallelujah\\nYou were an angel in the shape of my mum\\nYou got to see the person I have become\\nSpread your wings and I\\'ll know that\\nWhen God took you back he said Hallelujah\\nYou\\'re home...\\nThe club isn\\'t the best place to find a lover\\nSo the bar is where I go\\nMe and my friends at the table doing shots\\nDrinking faster and then we talk slow\\nCome over and start up a conversation with just me\\nAnd trust me I\\'ll give it a chance now\\nTake my hand, stop\\nPut Van The Man on the jukebox\\nAnd then we start to dance\\nAnd now I\\'m singing like\\n\\nGirl, you know I want your love\\nYour love was handmade for somebody like me\\nCome on now, follow my lead\\nI may be crazy, don\\'t mind me\\nSay, boy, let\\'s not talk too

know\\n\\nYou\\'re under my skin\\nBurning in my bloodstream\\nThese cars were the way that you left me\\nI guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin\\nBurning in my bloodstream\\nThese cars were the way that you left me\\nI guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me\\nA tattoo to remind me\\nA tattoo to remind me\\n\\nApologies for the way I\\'ve been\\nI couldn\\'t wash you off my skin\\nNo i, I couldn\\'t live without you\\nTears at night could drive but I know\\nI\\'m burning right the wire and lifeboats\\nYou could be in the way you play me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I

hard, heal me now\\n\\nYou\\'re under my skin\\nBurning in my bloodstream\\nThese cars were the way that you left me\\nI guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin\\nBurning in my bloodstream\\nThese cars were the way that you left me\\nI guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me\\nA tattoo to remind me\\nA tattoo to remind me\\nWhen your legs don\\'t work like they used to before\\nAnd I can\\'t sweep you off of your feet\\nWill your mouth still remember the taste of my love?\\nWill your eyes still smile from your cheeks?\\n\\nAnd darling I will be loving you \\'til we\\'re 70\\nAnd baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23\\nAnd I\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\nMaybe just the touch of a hand\\nWell, me I fall in love with you every single day\\nAnd I just wanna tell you I am\\nSo honey now\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nPlace your head on my beating heart\\nI\\'m thinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\n\\nWhen my hair\\'s all but gone and my memory fades\\nAnd the crowds don\\'t remember my name\\nWhen my hands don\\'t play the strings the same way\\nI know you will still love me the same\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it\\'s evergreen\\nAnd baby your smile\\'s forever in my mind and memory\\nI\\'m thinking \\'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\nMaybe it\\'s all part of a plan\\nWell, I\\'ll just keep on making the same mistakes\\nHoping that you\\'ll understand\\nBut baby now\\n\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nPlace your head on my beating heart\\nThinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\n\\nSo baby now\\nTake me into your loving arms\\nKiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\nOh darling, place your head on my beating heart\\nI\\'m thinking out loud\\nThat maybe we found love right where we are\\nOh baby we found love right where we are\\n\\nAnd we found love right where we are\\nWhite lips, pale face\\nBreathing in snowflakes\\nBurnt lungs, sour taste\\nLight\\'s gone, day\\'s end\\nStruggling to pay rent\\nLong nights, strange men\\n\\nAnd they say\\nShe\\'s in the Class A Team\\nStuck in her daydream\\nBeen this way since 18\\nBut lately her face seems\\nSlowly sinking, wasting\\nCrumbling like pastries\\nAnd they scream\\nThe worst things in life come free to us\\nCos we\\'re just under the upperhand\\nAnd go mad for a couple of grams\\nAnd she don\\'t want to go outside tonight\\nAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\\nOr sells love to another man\\nIt\\'s too cold outside\\nFor angels to fly\\nAngels to fly\\n\\nRipped gloves, raincoat\\nTried to swim and stay afloat\\nDry house, wet clothes\\nLoose change, bank notes\\nWeary-eyed, dry throat\\nCool girl, no phone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd they say\\nShe\\'s in the Class A Team\\nStuck in her daydream\\nBeen this way since 18\\nBut lately her face seems\\nSlowly sinking, wasting\\nCrumbling like pastries\\nAnd they scream\\nThe worst things in life come free to us\\nCos we\\'re just under the upperhand\\nAnd go mad for a couple of grams\\nAnd she don\\'t want to go outside tonight\\nAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\\nOr sells love to another

not a rapper\\nI\\'m a singer with a flow\\nI\\'ve got a habit of spitting\\nQuicker lyrics you know\\nYou found me ripping the writtens\\nOut of the pages they sit in\\nAnd never once I get bitten,\\nBecause plagiarism is hidden\\nWhich I would sit on the rhythm,\\nPrisoner with a vision\\n\\nSigned to a label, but didn\\'t listen to any criticism\\nThought you knew but you didn\\'t\\nSo perk your ears up and listen\\nStudio with a system\\nAnd you could say that I\\'m driven\\nAnd now it\\'s on to the next saga\\nWe drink the best lager\\nI never tried to win you\\nOver like your stepfather\\nI do my own thing now, and get respect after\\nAnd I\\'m avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter\\n\\nFor four years I never had a place to stay\\nBut it\\'s safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight\\nAt 16 years old I moved out of my home\\nI was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and\\nI choked\\nAnd we\\'ve been sleeping at the subway station, sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population\\nNot my imagination, I don\\'t want to relax\\nBut would it hurt your reputation,\\nIf I put it on wax?\\nI take it back now\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[chorus]\\nCome on and take it back love\\nCome on and take it back for us\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\n\\nTake it back with the rhythm and blues\\nAnd my back pack I\\'ll be singing the news,\\nTrying to act like Jack Black when I bring him to school\\nI\\'ll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop,\\nBringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,\\nI give you the truth through the vocal booth,\\nStars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit,\\nThey try and take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot,\\nBut then again that\\'s what they\\'re supposed to do,\\nAnd I\\'m supposed to be calm,\\nI tattooed the lyrics onto my arm, whispering everything that happens is from now on,\\nI\\'ll be ready to start it again at the end of the song,\\nStill they claiming that I handled it wrong,\\nBut then I never had an enemy, except for NME,\\nBut I\\'ll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be,\\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees,\\nAre healthier than a dalmatian with pedigree\\nSinging for the masses,\\nRubber dinghy rapids,\\nKeep this rapping a habit\\nAnd keep on fashioning magic,\\nI\\'m battling with respect,\\nI don\\'t know if I\\'ll have it,\\nThis songs from the heart,\\nCovering the planet,\\nI\\'ll take it back now\\n\\n[chorus]\\nCome on and take it back love\\nCome on and take it back for us\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\n\\nTake it back now\\nNow, I don\\'t ever want to be perfect,\\nCause I\\'m a singer that you\\nNever want to see shirtless\\nI accept the fact that someone\\'s got to win the worst-dressed,\\nTaking my first steps into the scene,\\nGiving me focus\\nPutting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton\\nConsidering a name change,\\nThinking it was hopeless\\nRhyming over recordings\\nAvoiding tradition\\nCause every day some lyrics\\nAnd a melody can be written\\nNow absence can make your heart ache\\nBut drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,\\nI need to let my liver be\\nAnd I say it again,\\nLiving life on the edge,\\nWith a closed hand full of friends\\nIs good advice from a man\\nWho took his life on the road with me\\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\\nCause that\\'s how it\\'s supposed to be\\nI\\'m screaming out vocally\\nMight seem totally impossible\\nAchieving life\\'s dreams\\nBut, but I just write schemes\\nI\\'m never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans\\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be\\nBut more likely,\\nYou\\'ll find me in the back\\nRoom of a dive bar with my mates\\nHaving a pint with McDaid\\nDiscussing records we made\\nAnd every single second knowing\\nThat we\\'ll never betray\\nThe way we were raised\\nRemembering our background\\nSat down\\nThat\\'s how we plan it out;\\nIt\\'s time to take it back now\\n\\n[chorus]\\nCome on and take it back love\\nCome on and take it back for us\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\n\\nCome on and take it back love\\nCome on and take it back for us\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love, oh\\n\\nMy dreams keep me awake at night\\nWritten in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype\\nAm I just living the lie\\nWith this you must know that the number\\'s just sold woah\\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\\nWe forget 90 per cent of it when we wake\\nBut the other 10 per cent it never fades\\nDreaming dreams, day to day goals\\nStay awake loads, try to make the cut like the\\nPaper or razor blade, oh, never give up\\nAnd just remember just to hold out more\\nA couple years ago\\nI couldn\\'t just control that thought\\nYou\\'d find me buskin\\' on the street\\nWhen it was cold outdoors\\nAnd now I\\'m sweating on the stage\\nOf a sold out tour\\nWriting love songs for the sake of it\\nNever to make a hit\\nYou can\\'t fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\\nI\\'m not a rapper I\\'m a singer, I just take the piss and\\nMost of these other guys are kids that posties\\nLittle sister has to babysit, that\\'s just a way it is\\nDreams are your own, just set your goals\\nAnd have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path\\nYou\\'ll never make it as a follower, you\\'ll never know\\nWhere you will go or where you will be tomorrow\\nYou look so wonderful in your dress\\nI love your hair like that\\nThe way it falls on the side of your neck\\nDown your shoulders and back\\n\\nWe are surrounded by all of these lights\\nAnd people who talk too much\\nYou\\'ve got that kind of look in your eyes\\nAs if no one knows anything but us\\n\\nAnd should this be the last thing I see\\nI want you to know it\\'s enough for me\\nCause all that you are is all that I\\'ll ever need\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m so in love, so in love\\nSo in love, so in love\\n\\nYou look so beautiful in this light\\nYour silhouette over me\\nThe way it brings out the blue in your eyes\\nIs the Tenerife sea\\n\\nAnd all of the voices surrounding us here\\nThey just fade out when you take a breath\\nJust say the word and I will disappear\\nInto the wilderness\\n\\nAnd should this be the last thing I see\\nI want you to know it\\'s enough for me\\nCause all that you are is all that I\\'ll ever need\\n\\nI\\'m so in love, so in love\\nSo in love, so in love\\n\\nLumiere, darling\\nLumiere over me [x6]\\n\\nAnd should this be the last thing I see\\nI want you to know it\\'s enough for me\\nCause all that you are is all that I\\'ll ever need\\n\\nI\\'m so in love, so in love\\nSo in love, love, love, love,\\nSo in love\\n\\nYou look so wonderful in your dress\\nI loved your hair like that\\nAnd in the moment I knew you best\\nNow I don\\'t wanna hate you\\nJust wish you\\'d never gone for the man\\nAnd waited two weeks at least\\nBefore you let him take you\\nI stayed true\\nI kind of knew you liked the dude from private school\\nHe\\'s waiting for the time to move\\nI knew he had his eyes on you\\nHe\\'s not the right guy for you\\nDon\\'t hate me cause I write the truth\\nNo I would never lie to you\\nBut it was never fine to lose you\\nAnd what a way to find out\\nIt never came from my mouth\\nYou never changed your mind\\nBut you were just afraid to mind out\\nBut f- it, I won\\'t be changing the subject I love it\\nI\\'ll make your little secret public it\\'s nothing\\nI\\'m just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me\\nTrapped and I\\'m lacking sleep\\nFact is you\\'re mad at me because I backtrack so casually\\nYou\\'re practically my family\\nIf we married then I\\'ll guess you\\'d have to be\\nBut tragically our love just lost the will to live\\nBut would I kill to give it one more shot\\nI think not\\n\\n[Hook]\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\nI don\\'t want you no\\nAnymore\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\nI don\\'t wanna love you no\\nAnymore\\n\\nRecently I tend to zone out\\nUp in my headphones to Holocene\\nYou promised your body but I\\'m away so much\\nI stay more celibate than in a monastery\\nI\\'m not cut out for life on the road\\nCause I didn\\'t know I\\'d miss you this much\\nAnd at the time we\\'d just go, so sue me\\nI guess I\\'m not the man that you need\\nEver since you went to uni\\nI\\'ve been sofa surfing with a rucksack\\nFull of less cash and I guess that could get bad\\nBut when I broke the industry\\nThat\\'s when I broke your heart\\nI was supposed to chart and celebrate\\nBut good things are over fast\\nI know it\\'s hard to deal with and see this\\nI tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features\\nThen I turn the music off\\nAnd all I\\'m left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus\\nI never really want to believe this\\nGot advice from my dad and he\\nTold me that family is all I\\'ll ever have and need\\nI guess I\\'m unaware of it\\nSuccess is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\nI don\\'t want you no\\nAnymore\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\nI don\\'t wanna love you no\\nAnymore\\n\\nAnd since you left, I\\'ve given up my days off\\nIt\\'s what I need to stay strong\\nI know you have a day job but mine is 24/7\\nI feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook\\nCause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could\\nThe irony is if my career and music didn\\'t exist\\nIn 6 years, yeah, you\\'d probably be my wife with a kid\\nI\\'m frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink\\nAnd lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it\\'s\\nJust hiding my misguiding thoughts that I\\'m trying to kill\\nAnd I\\'d be writing my will before I\\'m 27, I\\'ll die from a thrill\\nGo down in history as just a wasted talent\\nCan I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?\\nIt\\'s only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me\\nEventually I\\'ll be fine I know that it was never meant to be\\nEither way I guess I\\'m not prepared, but I\\'ll say this\\nThese things happen for a reason and you can\\'t change shit\\nTake my apology, I\\'m sorry for the honesty\\nBut I had to get this off my chest\\n\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\nI don\\'t want you no\\nAnymore\\nI don\\'t love you baby\\nI don\\'t need you baby\\nI don\\'t wanna love you no\\nAnymore\\nAin\\'t got a soapbox I can stand upon\\nBut God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song\\nMy daddy told me, \\\\\"Son, don\\'t you get involved in\\nPolitics, religions or other people\\'s quotes\\\\\"\\n\\nI\\'ll paint the picture, let me set the scene\\nI know when I have children they will know what it means\\nAnd I pass on these things my family\\'s given to me\\nJust love and understanding, positivity\\n\\nWe could change this whole world with a piano\\nAdd a bass, some guitar, grab a beat\\nAnd away we go\\nI\\'m just a boy with a one-man show\\nNo university, no degree\\nBut lord knows everybody\\'s talking \\'bout exponential growth\\nAnd the star monkey crashing in their portfolios\\nWhile I\\'ll be sitting here with a song I wrote\\nSing, love could change the world in a moment\\nBut what do I know?\\nLove can change the world in a moment\\nBut what do I know?\\nLove can change the world in a moment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe revolution\\'s coming, it\\'s a minute away\\nI saw people marching in the streets today\\nYou know we are made up of love and hate\\nBut both of them are balanced on a razor blade\\n\\nI\\'ll paint the picture, let me set the scene\\nI know, I\\'m all for people following their dreams\\nJust re-remember life is more than fitten\\' in your jeans\\nIt\\'s love and understanding, positivity\\n\\nWe could change this whole world with a piano\\nAdd a bass, some guitar, grab a beat\\nAnd away we go\\nI\\'m just a boy with a one-man show\\nNo university, no degree\\nBut lord knows everybody\\'s talking \\'bout exponential

the speakers played,\\nI\\'d be on tour almost every day When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay Just watching a dvd,\\nsmoking illegal weed,\\nGetting high as two kites when we needed to breath,\\nWe\\'d use each other\\'s air just for the people to see,\\nAnd stay up all night like when we needed to sleep,\\nWe\\'d go anywhere our minds would take us,\\nAnd I\\'d say you were beautiful without your make up,\\nAnd you don\\'t need even to worry about your weight cause We can all be loved the way that god made us,\\nAnd time\\'s the only reason that we could break up Cause

to get bitten,\\nCause plagiarism is hidden,\\nWatch how I sit on the rhythm,\\nPrisoner with a vision,\\nSigned to a label,\\nBut didn\\'t listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn\\'t,\\nSo perk your ears up and listen,\\nStudio is the system,\\nAnd you could say that I\\'m driven,\\nAnd now it\\'s onto the next saga,\\nWe drink the best lager,\\nI\\'ll never try to win you over like your stepfather,\\nI do my own thing now,\\nAnd get respect after,\\nAnd I\\'m avoiding the \\'caine,\\nLike it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay,\\nBut it\\'s safe to say that it kept me grounded,\\nLike a paper weight,\\nAt 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home,\\nI was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked,\\nWent from sleeping at a subway station,\\nTo sleeping with a movie star,\\nAnd adding to the population,\\nNot my imagination,\\nI don\\'t wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love,\\nCome on and take it back for us,\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love No I take it back with the rhythm and blues,\\nWith my rap pack I\\'ll be singing the news,\\nTryin\\' act like Jack Black,\\nWhen I bring it to school,\\nI make a beat with my feet,\\nBy just hittin\\' the loop,\\nBringing the lyrics to prove,\\nThat I can fit in these shoes,\\nI give you the truth through the vocal booth,\\nAnd stars burst out on the scene,\\nLike an opal fruit,\\nThey try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot,\\nBut then again that\\'s what they\\'re supposed to do,\\nAnd I\\'m supposed to be calm,\\nI tattooed the lyrics onto my arm,\\nWhispering everything that happens,\\nIs from now on I\\'ll be ready to start again By the end of the song,\\nSince they are claiming I handled it wrong,\\nBut then I\\'ve never had an enemy,\\nExcept the NME but I\\'ll be selling,\\nTwice as many copies as their magazine will ever be,\\nWith only spectacles ahead of me,\\nAnd festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree,\\nSinging for the masses rubber dingied rapids,\\nI keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic,\\nI\\'m battling for respect and I don\\'t know if I have it This song\\'s from the heart cover the planet,\\nI take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love,\\nCome on and take it back for us Don\\'t you fade into the back love,\\nNo,\\nAnd take it back now Now I don\\'t ever wanna be perfect,\\nCause I\\'m a singer that you never wanna see shirtless,\\nAnd I accept the fact that someone\\'s got to win worst dressed,\\nTaken my first steps into the scene giving me focus,\\nPutting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton,\\nConsidering a name change thinking it was hopeless,\\nRhyming over recordings,\\navoiding tradition,\\n\\'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written,\\nNow absence can make your heart ache,\\nBut drinking absinth can change your mind state,\\nVividly need to let my liver be,\\nAnd I\\'ll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends,\\nIs good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me,\\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally,\\n\\'Cause that how it\\'s supposed to be,\\nI\\'m screaming out vocally,\\nIt might seem totally impossible achieving life\\'s dreams,\\nBut,\\nbut I just write schemes I\\'m never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be,\\nBut more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we\\'ll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down,\\nthat\\'s how we plan it out,\\nIt\\'s time to take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love,\\nCome on and take it back for us,\\nDon\\'t you fade into the back love,\\nNo Mmm come on and take it back love,\\nCome on and take it
